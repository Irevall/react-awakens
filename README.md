### Recruitment task for Frontend Developer with React
##### Deployed with [GitHub Pages](https://irevall.github.io/react-awakens/)

##### Some afterthought
I'll be honest and admit that I didn't have a lot of prior experience with React.
I've spent first two days mainly learning about React and Hooks and honestly
that was quite fun.
MobX on the other hand was quite painful to get a hang of and I'm not 100% sure I nailed it.
I gave up on completing all optional tasks, but I added some of my own,
like Debouncing for both search and validation.

##### Optional tasks I haven't completed:
- GraphQL
- Tests
- TypeScript

I don't have much experience with either (only used TS with Backend)
and I didn't want to add another task on top of learning React and MobX.


##### Things I could have improved:
- Not fully taking advantage of Hooks
- MobX setup/usage
- Planet data grid is quite convoluted
- AppNewMovie component grew quite large
